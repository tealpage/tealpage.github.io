                    <h1>DRAFT ONLY</h1>
                    <h1>Signs of Inflation Peaking</h1>
                        <p>First, it was the odd article from farsighted analysts and experts, then its followed by the rounds of data; and by now, its increasingly clear to many that the peak of inflation has truly passed. In its stead seems to be a jittery game of “Will they won’t they” with interests’ rates and recession. The head of the Bank of England made a comment that inflation could come down as quickly as did the gas prices, and German Chancellor Schulz saying that a “soft landing” is possible (i.e. not going into recession), while the US seems to be easing off the throttle on interest rates rises. On the other hand, there is still concern that the whilst the interest rate rises are slowing, they might stay persistent; with the market seemingly twitching and itching in reaction on the slightest indication on either direction. So here is a short discussion on what is going on from an ignorant engineer on the side-line.</p>
                        <p>I’m sure most already have an understanding of the importance of interest rates and inflation; but in case for those that don’t like myself; we first will give a bit of context to give you a reason for you to care. Obviously doing weekly groceries and seeing the prices jump by 10% as it was the case in the UK is a reason enough for many. But there are also others, the risk of hyperinflation, the concern of interest rates changes and the potentially ensuing recession.</p>
                    <h1>Causes of Inflation & What does Interest Rates Do?</h1>
                        <p>So, what are the causes of inflation and why are they so bad now? A quick search online will tell you that there are 3 typically associated causes Cost Pushed Inflation, Demand Pulled Inflation, and Built-in inflation. Firstly, “Cost Pushed” Inflation. It is when the supply of products becomes more costly and subsequently the cost is passed on to consumers, it means that prices is then increased to match. This was argued to be the case for the current situation, with the Russo-Ukrainian situation earlier causing a rise in energy prices, which increases supply costs across the board. Secondly, “Demand Pulled” Inflation. It is where people for whatever reason might want a certain goods. Which with in-elastic supply, allows the producers to drive up the prices. </p>
                        <p>We can see that small amount of inflation can be good, as both of these provide an economic incentive (for demand pulled) or pressure (for cost pushed) for businesses to innovate and improve (aka growth). We use both The Consumer Price Index, a measure of year-on-year aggregate changes in consumer prices is often used to measure inflation together with employment rates (if you don’t have a job, you are less likely to want to spend). </p>
                        <p>Finally, there is “Built-In Inflation”, which has been left deliberately unmentioned till now. This is the causes of inflation that I would argue is the focus. Unchecked inflation can develop further inflation. The presences of inflation can cause a wage prices spiral, where employees demand wage rises proportional to inflation; causing further increases to production costs. Whilst on the other hand investors chases increasing returns to make sure they catch up with inflation, and might do so by increasingly risky decisions. A combination of expectation of continued demands, and growing costs; businesses is under increasing pressure to either expand or increase efficiency to make increasing profits. Mirroring this, capital needed to do so also comes cheap (both in terms of scrutiny and money) by investors looking to make their return targets. Whilst initially there is real growth with everything rosy, at some point it can crosses a blurry line into speculation. </p>
                        <p>So where do interest rates come into the picture? We assume that people don’t like to take un-nessicary risks, and major reputable governments is normally the least risky of institution out there. To steal a phrase from a youtuber, if there is a problem “there are probably much important things to worry about”/ this then acts as a proxy to the “risk free” rate (there are other alternatives like various IBORs or SOFA/SONIA). The implication of this is that there is rarely any reason to take any investment opportunities if it is worse than this rate. In turn it becomes the basis for the “cost of capital”, which the government uses (in conjunction with other methods) to throttle inflation, both by increasing the cost to take debt (supply side) and incentive to save (demand side).</p>
                        <p>In this case we have found that our best strategy also performed best for the blind set although there doesn't seem to be a direct correlation overall across the different strategies we investigated. Again, adjusted for 5bps assumed transaction costs the best of them achieving an annualised Sharpe of 1.96, Average Returns of 41.8%, and Max Draw Down of 21% compared to the an evenly weighted S&P 500 Index performance of Sharpe 0.82, Mean Annual Returns of 15.8% and Max Draw Down of 27% over the same back test period of around 5 years. </p>
                    <h1>So Will They? Or Won't They?</h1>
                        <p>This is a without a doubt, a difficult decision. To put on the brakes is painful; not only there is the fact of admitting over-optimism and redundant business will be cut down in turn meaning jobs are to be lost, it could also trigger a inflation. Whilst on the other hand spiring or hyper inflation is also no joke to be scoffed at and the longer the wait the more painful the downturn. And I’m sure having lived through the covid years, we know how we truly are in making these sorts of decisions.</p>
                        <p>So, where we are now? with the cost of natural gas coming rapidly down (commonly attributed to a milder winter) and assuming that the energy crisis is resolved. Supply Cost Push induced inflation then might have indeed truly passed its peak, notwithstanding China reopening. This all is clear, but for me the question lies in the case how much inflation is already baked in? </p>
                        <p>Firstly, there's a personal hunch. I’m not an economist, nor do I know if this is just usual business for Wall Street; But for me, seeing the mood of the news flipping between concern to optimism, and people jumping at any hint of information regarding inflation and interest rate is nevertheless jarring and disconcerting. This leaves me with an unsettling hunch, for the type of market behaviours that points towards inflation of the baked in variety persisting. Something which governments might want to quash or at least send a clear message for now. </p>
