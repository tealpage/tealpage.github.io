                    <h1>Project Goals</h1>
                        <p>
                            Hint if you have not figured yet, I am (currently) a big believer in projects as a way to explore, learn and practice things (Read more on why in entry X1!). Understandably building a website doesn’t really give you valuable skills per say… There are much more effective ways of build a “professional” website if you are willing to pay a little bit nor do I wanted to be a front-end software developer. Instead, I wanted to focus on a different thing when working on this project; and that being exploring and demonstrating “Agile” approaches to projects and learning.                    </p>
                        <p>
                            I mean I have not undertaken a course on agile software development but form my university lectures on agile start-ups (understandably this is for entrepreneurship but hey) I believe (at least in my understanding of things) the core concept is simple: <b> Minimise the “risk” of project failure.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to engineering safety critical components, the concept of risk here breaks down to the chance of failure, and also the cost of failure. In the agile (start-up) approach I’ve absorbed, we focus on reducing the cost of failure by introducing very small incremental steps, each with the minimum cost to achieve certain goal. In start-up theory this would be to test a business hypothesis. An analogy linking this to those probability problems; is like playing two dice games: The first one; you roll a dice once and receive a reward n times the face value; versus the second game, where you roll a dice n times, each receiving the face value. Even assuming the rolls are independent which is not analogous to our situation, the overall “risk” is still “reduced” in the second game. (Perhaps it would be interesting to model agile start-up this way in another time) as you can imagine not only the “risk” is reduced, the chance of success can also increase as it creates a feedback loop which introduce flexibility in the plan. When adapted to learning or project managing on a personal level, I think the analogy of costs for me is attention span, momentum and time spent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Much like Greedy algorithms, the downside of this agile method, at least when it comes to development or designs, is that there is not really guarantee for a globally optimal outcome or in this case even an outcome at all. I was in a university society team once and was explaining a mathematician friend about this believe in the team where if we all endured on the project for long enough, we will eventually achieve our goal. He very quickly pointed the limit as time worked on project tends to infinity is not guarantee to converge to full completion it, could just as well converge to 80%! (In the real this is like progress becoming more and more difficult due to all locally easy but ultimately bad decisions that is made along the way!). So, I also want to keep an eye out for this if possible…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, with that, I wanted to create a minimum viable product website that can showcase my projects, allow other people to connect. Again, to do so in the least risk trying to follow online tutorials and template codes as much as possible, and hopefully learning on the run. Sadly, due to the lack of html experience, it is not really possible to keep an eye out for potential long-term coding issues; I did say if possible. And it could be the case that the whole thing needs to be built again, but we will cross that bridge when we reach it, for now we shall have a shiny (minimally) functioning website!

                    <h1>Design Sketches</h1>
                        <p>So, with some great enthusiasm, I then set of to follow one of the many online tutorials, tweaking things along the way. Actually, I have made a fair bit of great progress going as far as making a navigation bar and home and about page. However, I realised I have a ran into my first issue: I realised that I have no overarching design or vision. This was quite demoralising as I just don’t really know what I wanted make, I know that I like a minimalism, but there still are some larger questions at hand. On one had I wanted to try for newer style work with a retro font and using more real images, which is a bit outside of my comfort zone to reflect a more series and professional language; on the other hand, I also like the idea of naming the and styling the page around the colour teal, namely a word plays on my initials T and L, But I just wasn’t sure how to incorporate the colour scheme with that new style (you can see which I have settled with, and perhaps will make a change in the future). And I very quickly lost a lot of motivation unable to make up my mind on the overall theme</p>
                        <div class="Entry-Images-Container">
                            <img src="images/projects/A BuildingThePage/A1/OriginalConcept.png" alt="">
                            <p>Original Page</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>I guess you might be asking what’s the big deal? I personally do consider having that overarching vision or design being very important. To go on a tangent to (maybe slightly) demonstrate the point, at my university the student body decided to renovate a games room. Wanting to make the room brighter and perhaps more modern in look, they picked a light off grey colour and replaced the lights with ones with a whiter tone. Note that both of these decisions can work individually. But unsurprisingly, with the combination of lighting and wall colour, together with the out of place furniture, the room ended up looking like a prison rec room! (They ended spending more to revert all the changes after a few years)</p>
                        <div class="Entry-Images-Container">
                            <img src="images/projects/A BuildingThePage/A1/BeansConcept.png" alt="">
                            <p>Beans!</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>After some time I have decided to give the teal page concept a try. Sitting down I then drew up the concepts for each of the page I’ve wanted to make, what each page will look like as you can see with the pictures below. This is genuinely a very fun part of the website making process, designing your webpage without having to worry (at the moment) about all the difficulties and annoyance of the code. Trying to stick with the colour “Teal”  I have chosen a very simplistic design with one of my current favourite font “Century Gothic” and a sharp orange colour to serve as highlights.  Along the way I have also created the “bean” logo modelled after a teal-coloured green (keen) bean which I am quite happy with (and then proceed to spend much time making different bean variations) , although now the style is definitely drifting towards a more cartoonish look, (with its obvious pros and cons). This whole process I have found to be immensely beneficial later on. Being quite satisfied with the design, all that is left now are the sprints towards code functionality. </p>
