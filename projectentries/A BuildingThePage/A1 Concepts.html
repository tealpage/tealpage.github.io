                    <h1>Project Goals</h1>
                        <p>
                            Hint if you have not figured yet, I am (currently) a big believer in projects as a way to explore, learn and practice things (Read more on <a href="projectentries/X Other_Stuff/About the Page.html">Here</a> ). Understandably crash building a website using only basic html, javascript and css doesn’t really give you valuable skills per say… There are much more efficient ways of build a “professional” website if you are willing to pay a little bit nor do I particularly wanted to be a front-end software developer at the moment. Instead, I wanted to focus on a different thing when working on this project; and that being exploring and demonstrating “Agile” approaches to projects and learning.                    </p>
                        <p>
                            I mean I have not undertaken a course on agile software development but form my university lectures on agile start-ups (understandably this is for entrepreneurship but hey) I believe (at least in my understanding of things) the core concept is simple: <b> Minimise the “risk” of project failure by increasing adpatability</b>
                        </p>

                        <!-- An analogy linking this to those probability problems; is like playing two dice games: The first one; you roll a dice once and receive a reward n times the face value; versus the second game, where you roll a dice n times, each receiving the face value. Even assuming the rolls are independent which is not analogous to our situation, the overall “risk” is still “reduced” in the second game. (Perhaps it would be interesting to model agile start-up this way in another time) as you can imagine not only the “risk” is reduced, the chance of success can also increase as it creates a feedback loop which introduce flexibility in the plan.-->


                        <p>
                            Similar to engineering safety critical components, we break down the concept of risk to the chance of failure, and also the cost of failure. In the agile (start-up) approach I’ve absorbed, we focus on reducing the cost of failure by introducing very small incremental steps, each with the minimum cost to achieve a certain goal. In start-up theory, this would be to test a business hypothesis, in managing a project it could be to solve a specific problem or implement a specific feature. Then when translated to learning or project managing on a personal level, I think the analogy of costs for me is my attention span, momentum and time spent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I believe this works by allowing the project to firstly be much by flexible, the plan can change on the fly depending on the results of the hypothesis testing/ progress/ feedback. But also secondly, focusing more on a “just do it” kind of attitude. This saves from excessive planning and also by having small and manageable goals, it can allow us to build momentum.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But it also not without its downside; much like Greedy algorithms, at least when it comes to projects, is that there is not really guarantee for a globally optimal outcome or in this case even an outcome at all. I was in a university society team once and was explaining a mathematician friend about this believe in the team where if we all endured on the project for long enough, we will eventually achieve our goal. He very quickly pointed the limit as time worked on project tends to infinity is not guarantee to converge to full completion it, could just as well converge to 80%! (In the real this is like progress becoming more and more difficult due to all locally easy but ultimately bad decisions that is made along the way!). So, I also want to keep an eye out for this if possible…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, with that, I wanted to create a minimum viable product website that can showcase my projects, allow other people to connect. Again, to do so in the least risk trying to follow online tutorials and template codes as much as possible, and hopefully learning on the run. Sadly, due to the lack of html experience, it is not really possible to keep an eye out for potential long-term coding issues; I did say if possible. And it could be the case that the whole thing needs to be built again, but we will cross that bridge when we reach it, for now we shall have a shiny (minimally) functioning website!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Minimum Website with:</b>
                                <ul>

                        </p>
                    <!-- This was quite demoralising as I just don’t really know what I wanted make, I know that I like a minimalism, but there still are some larger questions at hand. -->
                    <h1>Design Sketches</h1>
                        <p>So, with some great enthusiasm, I then set off to follow one of the many online tutorials, tweaking things along the way. Actually, I have made a fair bit of progress going as far as making a navigation bar and home and about page. However, I realised that I have a ran into my first issue, I realised that I have no overarching design or vision. I was conflicted between two choices: On one hand, I wanted to try for newer style work with a retro font and using more real images, which I'm less familiar with to reflect a more series and professional design language; On the other hand, I had liked the idea of naming the and styling the page around the colour teal, namely a word play on my initials T and L (I didn't particularly want to name my site GenericFullName.com like what seems like everyone else...), But just wasn’t sure how to incorporate the colour scheme with the more serious style (you can see which I have settled with, and perhaps will make a change in the future). I very quickly lost a lot of motivation unable to make up my mind on the overall theme</p>
                        <div class="Entry-Images-Container">
                            <img src="images/projects/A BuildingThePage/A1/OriginalConcept.png" alt="">
                            <p>Original Page</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>I guess you might be asking what’s the big deal? Maybe its the more "artsy" (not that I have any particular experties) side of me screaming internally, but I very much believe its the main culprit of causing the revenovated games room in my university to look like a prison rec room. Yes, it's much worse than before the renovation, and Yes, they decided to basically revert everything back after a few years presumably wasting thousands of pounds in the whole fiasco </p>
                        <div class="Entry-Images-Container">
                            <img src="images/projects/A BuildingThePage/A1/BeansConcept.png" alt="">
                            <p>Beans!</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In the end, I decided to just give the "teal" concept a try. Sitting down I then drew up initial concepts for each of the pages needed (and also came up with the bean mascot/ logo along the way, which I'm very happy with). I have found this a very fun part of the website-making process, designing your webpage without having to worry (at the moment) about all the difficulties needing to implement things in code.</p>
                        <p>The end product is this more minimalistic design with a darker “Teal” main-colour, bright orange highlights and one of my favourite fonts “Century Gothic”, obviously with the bean logo liberally plastered. The style now is definitely drifting towards a more cartoonish look (with its obvious pros and cons), but I guess I’ll stick with this for now. I will find later that having these references pages to be immensely beneficial later on, but that will be for the next entry. Being quite satisfied with the design, all that is left now are the sprints towards code functionality. </p>
