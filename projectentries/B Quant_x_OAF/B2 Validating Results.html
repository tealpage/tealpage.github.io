                        <h1>Addressing hindsight</h1>
                            <p>This is relatively simply done by splitting our data set further so we reserve a blind set to use as if we are to implement the strategy. To do so we train the different strategies and test them, then finally select the best and essentially see what happens</p>
                            <p>In this case we have found that our best strategy also performed best for the future although there isn’t a direct correlation overall across the different strategies. Again, adjusted for 5bps assumed transaction costs the best of them achieving an annualised <b>Sharpe of 1.96, Average Returns of 41.8%, and Max Draw Down of 21%</b> compared to the an evenly weighted S&P 500 Index performance of Sharpe 0.82, Mean Annual Returns of 15.8% and Max Draw Down of 27% over the same back test period of around 5 years. </p>

                        <h1>Addressing Risk Exposure</h1>
                            <p>To address risk exposure, one suggestion from the feedback was to test using linear regression models. This comes from the work of Fama-French where they showed that around 70% of returns can be modelled as a linear combination of 3 factors. This was later expanded to 5 factors and research continued to expand this set of factors further. The return not modelled is then referred to as “alpha”</p>
                            <p>We conducted this analysis by using the vanilla 3 Factor model. this was because that there is a limitation on the data that I can collect given the project scope and that the discussion on arbitrarily including more factors seems inconclusive at a glance. This returned analysis returned an annualised alpha of 15% for our strategy although ideally, we would include factors that would be specific to the EAP</p>
                        <h1>Addressing Other Risks</h1>
                           <p>Finally, to address the “unquantified” or other risks we uses Monte Carlo simulation, which as from a very helpful feedback from an acquaintance. This is basically to randomly generate different strategies to see how much statistically likely our specific result can be obtained compared to random samples. We then can use hypothesis testing technique form statistics to see if the result strategies is significant. </p>
