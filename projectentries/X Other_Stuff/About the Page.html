                    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                        <p>I don’t particularly want myself to be in the centre stage of the site but rather I want things to focus on sharing projects and ideas in both directions. But I guess I should give a little bit about myself I guess: I go by Toby, recent graduate from HK. Studied in the UK for a while and did engineering at Uni (it’s a general engineering course but I’d like to say I “specialized” towards control and information engineering); and yeah my hobbies are: procrastinating, sketching/doodling, anime enjoying, running and hopefully now this blog site (not in any particular order)</p>
                    <h1>What is the page for?</h1>
                        <p>So, the idea about this page to ultimately encourage myself to do more projects. I find myself being very motivated by others, whether that is feeling an obligation for commitments made to other people or feeling inspired by other passionate people. It’s a platform for me to shout out into void and also hopefully hear back from people from time to time. By doing so I hope I can visualise the progress made and interact with others about these projects to create positive feedback. And on the other hand to introduce a timeframe and structure to my projects into introduce a bit of pressure that way</p>
                    <h1>Why projects?</h1>
                        <p>Well this is a thought has been slowly crystalising for a while reflecting on my time in school and university. It comes firstly from my observations on some of my very talented friends, a key distinction between them and other people I’ve met is that they often do very cool side projects. Over time I think it differentiated them both in having a good track record results and also building in incredible repertory of skills.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, is also through my own experience of doing those online courses like on *certain sites*. No matter long or short, whilst I think that they are good at providing a solid foundation for theory; they are not very good at giving you skills. As the old saying goes “the devil is in the details”. Because of that I have found that these courses don’t really directly translate to practice; and practice, is king.</p>
                    <h1>Posting Schedules?</h1>
                        <p>Everything at the moment is still in early stages so I don’t know how long what I say will now will last. I think that for project posts, around 2-ish months is the current target, and hopefully this can give enough time to make enough progress and also write everything up.</p>
                        <p>I also hope to do some smaller self-contained stuff on the side and hopefully those can be more frequent. But as I’ve said I’m still figuring things out and either way will keep things updated on the update page!</p>
